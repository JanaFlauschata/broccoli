## FAQ

### Can I Import Recipes From Text Files Into Broccoli?
Broccoli can only import it's own backup files (which can be created via "Backup & Restore"). But if you are technical adept and have some scripting skills you can create a `broccoli-archive` file yourself.

The `broccoli-archive` is basically a zip file which consists of other zip files (one `broccoli` file for each recipe) and a JSON file for the categories. Each `broccoli` file consists of an optional image file and a JSON file with describes the recipe's metadata. Create an export yourself and have a look at the resulting file.

The following task have to be done:
1. Create the JSON file for each recipe (depending on the structure of your text files)
2. Zip this file (with an optional image file) into a `broccoli` file
3. Create a JSON file which describes your categories (in case you have any)
4. Zip the JSON and all the `broccoli` files into a `broccoli-archive`
5. Import the `*.broccoli-archive` into Broccoli
