Welcome to Broccoli 0.6.1. We have many improvements for you!

The seasonal calendar has been simplified so it can be understood better and the logic behind it has been tweaked so that it should fit most recipes.

And we have fixed many issues, for example
- duplicate entries in the seasonal calendar
- wrong sorting in the seasonal calendar
- buttons getting missing

And furthermore you can now share a recipe including its source URL, so that your friends can easily research more about it.

Have fun cooking!
